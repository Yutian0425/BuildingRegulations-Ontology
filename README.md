ðŸ“˜ Overview

This ontology defines the core classes and properties required for automated compliance checking of residential building regulations in a Building Information Modeling (BIM) environment.
It is designed to support SHACL-based rule validation and linked data interoperability with IFC and Revit models.

The ontology enables:
Semantic description of architectural spaces (e.g., bedrooms, kitchens, bathrooms, corridors)
Encoding of measurable attributes (e.g., usable area, net height, clear width)
Alignment with IFC 4 entities (ifc:IfcSpace, ifc:IfcDoor, etc.)
Integration with pyRevit-based BIM data extraction workflows
This work forms part of a research framework exploring ontology-enabled BIM compliance checking and digital twin trust mechanisms for the AEC industry.
